# SportyPython
The sporty side of Python
Python used in combination with OCR to extract some sports-data from my apple watch and analyse it

Just for fun I wanted to analyse some data on my health that my apple watch provides me with. this presentation does not really solve a societal issue but is more of a fun kind of thing... I wil present in my talk how to apply Google's library tesseract within Python. It serves as OCR library. I will apply it on screencaptures of my AppleWatch and will show a) how to do it and b) learnt lessons I took within the process. Also I will try to present how results can be improved by some preprocessing steps - and which of those tries failed.
This presentation was held at GeoPython Conference 2019 in Muttenz (Switzerland) on June 26th 2019 (https://submit.geopython.net/geopython2019/talk/GYJKD3/)
